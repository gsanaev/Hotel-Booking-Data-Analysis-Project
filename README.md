# **Finding a Good Deal among Hotels in main German cities**

### **Introduction**

This dataset comprises hotel information from four major German cities: Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Munich. The data was collected from the booking.com website and specifically includes hotels with available rooms for a selected night during weekdays.

It's important to note that not all hotels are listed on booking.com, which may introduce selection bias, as other hotels not listed on the site could potentially offer better deals. To mitigate this limitation, additional data from other sources would be beneficial. However, this case study focuses exclusively on data obtained from booking.com.

The dataset encompasses various types of accommodations, including hotels with available rooms for the selected night. It contains 1612 observations. The dataset variables provide comprehensive hotel information, such as hotel name, address, room price (in Euros), and more. For confidentiality reasons, hotel names and addresses have been replaced with numerical ID variables.


### **Goal of the Research**

The primary objective of this study is to analyze hotel data from key German cities, compare room prices, and identify good deals. The focus is on finding hotels that are underpriced relative to their location and quality.
